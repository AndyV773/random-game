## Scope

My aim is to create a simple random card-style game where the user is up against the computer. The user will need to click "Add Funds" to add an amount to the fund section, which will work in increments of 5. The user can choose a stake in amounts of 5, 10, and 20. When the user clicks "Draw," a card number will appear on the board for both the player and the computer.

The result is simple: the highest card ranking will win, with 2 being the lowest and A (Ace) being the highest. The computer will calculate the winner and add the funds to either the player's score or the computer's score. It is a game of complete chance based on a random number generator.

The user will also be able to add up to a maximum of 3 players. Each player is up against the computer, and their scores will be listed separately on the board. When the player decides to cash out, the total score will be added to the funds.

## Future Features

With more time, I would like to add the following features to the game:

1. **Additional Players:**
I plan to expand the game allowing for more players, making it more engaging.

2. **Draw Scenario:**
In the event of a draw, I intend to introduce a feature where players can choose to either:
- **Surrender:** The player loses the round, forfeiting their stake.
- **Go to War:** The player must double their stake and play an additional round to determine the winner. 

3. **Full set of Cards with Images**
I would also like to implement a full deck of cards with visual representations for each card. This will enhance the user experience by making the game more visually appealing.

This will make the game more fun and engaging.
