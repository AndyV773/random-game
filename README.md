# Love Gambling

**Love Gambling** is a casino war-style game where users face off against the computer/dealer. Players can add funds, choose their stake, add multiple players, and cash out when they're done. At the end of the game, you'll see your initial investment compared to your final total to assess your performance. The game features a simple, responsive design that works seamlessly without media queries. The odds can be adjusted in the code to favor the computer slightly. I alse kept the global variables to a minimum, using only "const" for button variables globally. Although this approach introduced some repetition, it helped keep the code relatively tidy and organized.

## User Story

A curious customer, intrigued by the allure of the game, decides to gamble a small amount of money. Luck is on his side, and he wins, encouraging him to keep playing. The thrill of victory drives him to place more bets. However, soon the tide turns, and he begins to lose. Determined to win back his losses, he continues to gamble, pouring more money into the game. Before he realizes it, his funds are depleted, and heâ€™s in debt. The moral of the story.. the computer always wins in the end.


## Scope

My aim is to create a simple random card-style game where the user is up against the computer. The user will need to click "Add Funds" to add an amount to the fund section, which will work in increments of 5. The user can choose a stake in amounts of 5, 10, and 20. When the user clicks "Draw," a card number will appear on the board for both the player and the computer.

The result is simple: the highest card ranking will win, with 2 being the lowest and A (Ace) being the highest. The computer will calculate the winner and add the funds to either the player's score or the computer's score. It is a game of complete chance based on a random number generator.

The user will also be able to add up to a maximum of 3 players. Each player is up against the computer, and their scores will be listed separately on the board. When the player decides to cash out, the total score will be added to the funds.

I have rigorously tested all buttons and functionality to ensure everything works as expected. This includes verifying that scores are calculated correctly, the correct player wins each round, and all buttons function properly.

## Future Features

With more time, I would like to add the following features to the game:

1. **Draw Scenario:**
In the event of a draw, I intend to introduce a feature where players can choose to either:
- **Surrender:** The player loses the round, forfeiting their stake.
- **Go to War:** The player must double their stake and play an additional round to determine the winner. 

2. **Full set of Cards with Images:**
I would like to implement a full deck of cards with visual representations for each card. This will enhance the user experience by making the game more visually appealing.

3. **Card Animation:**
I would also like to implement a time-delayed animation. When bets are placed, the cards will go through an animation for a few seconds before revealing the final selection.

This will make the game more fun and engaging.
